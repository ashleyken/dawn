Graphics I need
- all manufacturers logos
- mat template / mat colours / mat trims / mat text

Things for me to do
- graphical focus for the next step on the three dropdowns
- can I avoid the browser trying to set the same settings on back button after completing the form?

Questions for Mike
- Image banner text on homepage, can we have HTML like <br> actually I've realised it's not a slideshow as I think we needed, will come back
- that footer section css thing, should I just put my custom CSS at the bottom instead of using !important
- need to add 'find my car' to the sports team collections, I did previously make collection-list-sports-template and I added <input type="hidden" id="collectionHandle" value="{{ collection.handle }}"> for some reason, I used this in both homepage-dropdowns.liquid and reg-lookup.liquid, that I've now combined into find-my-car.liquid - ah yes, it was to keep the collection in the URL structure when coming from a sports page
  I'm not sure how the templates work now they're json based rather than liquid based
- how to add breadcrumbs to model page (all pages?)


Things that I've done to update this theme
- added /assets/custom.css.liquid file to /layout/theme.liquid like this 	 {{ 'custom.css' | asset_url | stylesheet_tag }}
- created /sections/find-my-car.liquid
- updated /templates/index.json to include in sections (this makes it appear as a section in the admin site)	
"find-my-car": {
	"type": "find-my-car"
}
